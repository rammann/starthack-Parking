Prototype code for polynomial regression for prediction occupancy of Park & Rail spaces.
We used data from SBB on bought tickets from 2019 along with hourly weather data from Yverdon-les-bains from the same year.

The polynomial least-squares-fit that was used can also be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression
